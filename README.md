# carDHTML
Business card creation tool built with nw.js

## DHTML? Seriously?
Yeah. It's the best umbrella term for HTML & CSS & JavaScript out there, imo.

## What exactly does it do?
You input a HTML file with associated styles and scripts and this bad boy renders it as a PNG for you with [html2canvas.js](http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/). You can set the output dimensions as you like or choose from a  list of countries' standard sizes.

## Why is it a standalone app? Wouldn't it be possible to implement the same functionality in a web page?
While this app is essentially a web page in a webkit browser and it is certainly possible to do the same job without standing alone, I did this as an exercise to take a look at the nw.js -project.

## Can I contribute?
Yes, please. The UI needs some work, so you can start with that if you like!
